              >Gracious but steely, [Mandela] steered a country in turmoil
              toward a negotiated settlement: a country that days before its
              first democratic election remained violent, riven by divisive
              views and personalities. He endorsed national reconciliation, an
              idea he did not merely foster in the abstract, but performed with
              panache and conviction in reaching out to former adversaries. He
              initiated an era of hope that, while not long-lasting, was
              nevertheless decisive, and he garnered the highest international
              recognition and affection.</em
